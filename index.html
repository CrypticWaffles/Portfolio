                    Building this site provided practical experience in website hosting, including utilizing GitHub Pages for static site deployment. I gained insights into domain name acquisition and DNS server setup through NoIP. Furthermore, it reinforced my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating responsive web designs.

                  A Java-based Android movie tracking application designed to help users keep track of their favorite films.
                  This project was developed as a practice exercise in Android development, utilizing SQLite for local data storage.

                  This was an individual school project focused on learning Android development. I was responsible for all phases, from conceptualization and design to implementation. I chose to build a movie tracking app to explore mobile development concepts.
                  This project is not currently under active development, but I may revisit it in the future.

                  Through this project, I gained significant experience with the Android framework and its components for building mobile applications.
                  I also acquired practical skills in working with SQLite for local database management on Android devices.
